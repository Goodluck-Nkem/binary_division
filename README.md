# binary_division
This project performs an integer division without using the division operator.

This code up to this moment is implemented only in C.
It uses the binary division algorithm directly, without much trickery.
Both the quotient and remainder are calculated.

This project is my first utilizing git locally from my machine. 
I think it went great.
